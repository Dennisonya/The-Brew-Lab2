**Project Design requires**
1. Color Palette: use of warm earthy tones like brown, beige and creams paired with accent colors like soft greens or oranges for contrast.

2. Responsive Design: Ensure the site is mobile friendly, as many users might access it.

3. Typography: A playful yet legible font, perhaps a script for 
headings and a clean modern font for the body.
